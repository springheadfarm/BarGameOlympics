			<p class="lead">There are no additional rules, per se, to Golden Tee -- the game is the game as 
			served up by the machine.</p>

			<p class="lead">Just a couple notes and guidelines about the event:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
				The event will consist of two stages: the qualifying rounds and a standard medal 
				round bracket.  In the qualifying rounds, players will pair off one player 
				from Group A and one from Group B.  The top four scores from the qualifying 
				round will advance to the medal round.
				</li>
			
				<li>Before the first two players start the qualifying round, the control ball 
				will be spun to determine the course on which <em>all</em> qualifying round 
				matches will be played. </li>

				<li>Before <em>each</em> medal round match, the control ball will be spun to 
				determine the course.  This is done before all medal round matches -- that 
				is, each medal round match could be played on a different course.  If both players agree to play a specific 
				course, the spin is skipped and the selected course is played.</li>
	
				<li>At no time, should there be any discussion between players of <em>how</em> any shot 
				or hole should be played.  Casual discussion about the game and match is, 
				of course, allowed.  But no conversation should take place that could be 
				interpreted as &quot;help&quot; or &quot;advice&quot; on how to play -- mechanically or 
				strategically.  Occasional score kibitzing is fine,  but no course 
				&quot;scouting&quot;.</li>
	
				<li>After the BGO has begun, players are not allowed to practice prior to their 
				opening round.</li>
			
			</ul>
