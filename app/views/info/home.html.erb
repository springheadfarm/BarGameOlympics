                    BGO 8 is in the books!  After an amazing two days of exciting competition,
                    perennial contendor Doug Dixon took home the all around gold.  Lots more details

                    The only sour moment of BGO 8 was the last minute no-show of wannabe Miss BGO
                    Laura Sheppard.  In BGO tradition, to celebrate Laura's no-show, for the next couple
                    weeks we will be hosting the Laura Sheppard Joke of the Day.  ENJOY!
